# Deployment
[RideMe](https://github.com/team-evian-fiicode25) cloud infrastructure specification.

This repository contains:
- [Helpful scripts](https://github.com/team-evian-fiicode25/deployment/tree/main/bin)
    to prepare, launch, and integrate with the cloud resources.
- [Terraform files](https://github.com/team-evian-fiicode25/deployment/tree/main/terraform)
    to create AWS resources.
- [Kubernetes Manifests](https://github.com/team-evian-fiicode25/deployment/tree/main/kubernetes-manifests)
    to specify Docker images to run and how they scale. Kubernetes also provides load balancers between those.
